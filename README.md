# License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition-using-YOLO
License Plate Detection and Recognition using YOLO is a computer vision project that detects vehicle number plates in images using the YOLO algorithm. OCR is then applied to extract the text from the plates.

### Explanation:
- **Project Overview**: The License Plate Detection and Recognition using YOLO project based on the YOLOv5 model for license plate detection of vehicles in real-time and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the license plate numbers from image or videos. This system also make possible effectual and automated identification of vehicle for parking area management system, toll booth system as well as security systems. Adjusted and adaptable to other environments, high accuracy and speed, can be further optimized for specific datasets.
  
- **Technologies Used**:
    1. YOLOv5: A state-of-the-art object detection model for detecting license plates in images.
    2. OpenCV: A computer vision library for image processing tasks such as loading, manipulating, and displaying images.
    3. Tesseract OCR: An optical character recognition tool used to extract text from license plates.
    4. Python: The primary programming language for implementing the detection and recognition pipeline.
    5. PyTorch: A deep learning framework used to train and run the YOLOv5 model.
    6. NumPy: A library for handling numerical operations, especially for image processing tasks.
